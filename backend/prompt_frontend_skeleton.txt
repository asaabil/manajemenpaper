You are an expert React frontend engineer.  
I am building the frontend for a paper management system. The backend already exists (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB) and exposes a REST API with JWT-based authentication and role-based access (admin, dosen, mahasiswa).  

My requirements for the frontend:  
1. Use **React with Vite** as the project setup.  
2. Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.  
3. Use **React Query (TanStack Query)** for data fetching and caching.  
4. Authentication flow:  
   - Login page (email, password)  
   - Register page (name, email, password, role selection: admin/dosen/mahasiswa)  
   - Save JWT token in **localStorage** after login.  
   - Auto-redirect to Login if the user is not authenticated.  
   - Decode JWT to get user role, then hide UI elements based on role.  
5. Role-based UI behavior:  
   - Admin: sees all features.  
   - Dosen: can upload/edit their own papers, create reading lists.  
   - Mahasiswa: can only view papers, create reading lists.  
   (UI difference is only by hiding/showing buttons, not separate layouts).  
6. Pages to implement now (skeleton only, no full logic):  
   - `/login` → login form  
   - `/register` → registration form  
   - `/dashboard` → protected page, show "Welcome [role]"  
7. Implement routing with **React Router v6**.  
8. Create a reusable `api.js` helper using axios with interceptors (inject token from localStorage).  
9. Create `useAuth` hook that provides login, register, logout, and role-based checks.  
10. Create a simple `ProtectedRoute` component for private routes.  
11. Use Tailwind for clean but minimal styling (responsive forms, buttons, cards).  
12. Do not implement paper upload, search, or reading list yet. Only skeleton and auth flow.

Task:  
- Generate a complete Vite project with the above setup.  
- Show me the file structure and key files (main.jsx, App.jsx, pages, hooks, context, api).  
- Write the code for each file.
