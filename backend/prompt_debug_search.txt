You are an expert Node.js backend engineer.  
I am building a paper management system with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  

The issue:  
- Papers are successfully saved to MongoDB with fields like `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `categories`.  
- When I call the search endpoint (`GET /search?q=AI&scope=papers`), the response is `success: true` but `papers: []`.  
- Example document in the `papers` collection looks like this:
{
  "title": "My First Paper",
  "abstract": "Testing upload",
  "keywords": ["AI"],
  "categories": ["Machine Learning"]
}

Task:  
1. Inspect my `search.service.js` and `search.controller.js` code.  
2. Tell me if I am using MongoDB Atlas `$search` operator or a regular MongoDB `$text` index.  
3. If it is Atlas Search, explain step-by-step how to configure the Search Index in MongoDB Atlas for the `papers` collection.  
4. If it is `$text` search, show me the exact MongoDB command to create the right index (covering `title`, `abstract`, `keywords`, `categories`).  
5. Suggest the minimal code change (if needed) so the query for `q=AI` returns the paper above.  
6. Return the fixed code for `search.service.js` if required.
