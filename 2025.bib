abstract = {User Stories record what must be built in projects that use agile practices. User Stories serve both to estimate effort, generally measured in Story Points, and to plan what should be done in a Sprint. Therefore, it is essential to train software engineers on how to create simple, easily readable, and comprehensive User Stories. For that reason, we designed, implemented, applied, and evaluated a web application called User Story Tutor (UST). UST checks the description of a given User Story for readability, and if needed, recommends appropriate practices for improvement. UST also estimates a User Story effort in Story Points using Machine Learning techniques. As such UST may support the continuing education of agile development teams when writing and reviewing User Stories. UST's ease of use was evaluated by 40 agile practitioners according to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and AttrakDiff. The TAM evaluation averages were good in almost all considered variables. Application of the AttrakDiff evaluation framework produced similar good results. Apparently, UST can be used with good reliability. Applying UST to assist in the construction of User Stories is a viable technique that, at the very least, can be used by agile developments to complement and enhance current User Story creation.},

abstract = {UML is the de facto standard notation for graphically representing software. UML diagrams are used in the analysis, construction, and maintenance of software systems. Mostly, UML diagrams capture an abstract view of a (piece of a) software system. A key purpose of UML diagrams is to share knowledge about the system among developers. The quality of the layout of UML diagrams plays a crucial role in their comprehension. In this paper, we present an automated method for evaluating the layout quality of UML class diagrams. We use machine learning based on features extracted from the class diagram images using image processing. Such an automated evaluator has several uses: (1) From an industrial perspective, this tool could be used for automated quality assurance for class diagrams (e.g., as part of a quality monitor integrated into a DevOps toolchain). For example, automated feedback can be generated once a UML diagram is checked in the project repository. (2) In an educational setting, the evaluator can grade the layout aspect of student assignments in courses on software modeling, analysis, and design. (3) In the field of algorithm design for graph layouts, our evaluator can assess the layouts generated by such algorithms. In this way, this evaluator opens up the road for using machine learning to learn good layouting algorithms. Approach.: We use machine learning techniques to build (linear) regression models based on features extracted from the class diagram images using image processing. As ground truth, we use a dataset of 600+ UML Class Diagrams for which experts manually label the quality of the layout. Contributions.: This paper makes the following contributions: (1) We show the feasibility of the automatic evaluation of the layout quality of UML class diagrams. (2) We analyze which features of UML class diagrams are most strongly related to the quality of their layout. (3) We evaluate the performance of our layout evaluator. (4) We offer a dataset of labeled UML class diagrams. In this dataset, we supply for every diagram the following information: (a) a manually established ground truth of the quality of the layout, (b) an automatically established value for the layout-quality of the diagram (produced by our classifier), and (c) the values of key features of the layout of the diagram (obtained by image processing). This dataset can be used for replication of our study and others to build on and improve on this work.
