You are an expert React frontend engineer.  
I am building a paper management system frontend with React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, React Query, and React Router v6.  
The backend already exists (Node.js + Express.js + MongoDB with JWT authentication and role-based access).  

Current status:  
- Auth flow (login, register, logout, token saved in localStorage, ProtectedRoute) is already working.  
- Now I want to build all the main features for the app.

Requirements:  

1. **Papers Page (/papers)**  
   - Display list of papers in a table or card layout.  
   - Each paper shows title, authors, categories, viewCount, downloadCount.  
   - Include search bar (calls backend search API).  
   - Add pagination support.  
   - Each item has link to `/papers/:id` for details.

2. **Paper Detail Page (/papers/:id)**  
   - Show title, abstract, authors, keywords, publicationDate, categories.  
   - Show file info (download button → calls backend download API).  
   - Increment viewCount automatically when visiting.  
   - If logged in as mahasiswa/dosen: show button "Add to Reading List".  
   - If logged in as dosen (owner) or admin: show button "Edit" and "Delete".

3. **Upload Paper Page (/upload)**  
   - Role: dosen, admin only.  
   - Form with file input (drag-drop or regular).  
   - Metadata fields: title, abstract, authors, keywords (comma separated), categories, publicationDate.  
   - Submit calls backend upload endpoint (multipart/form-data).  
   - Show success/error messages.

4. **Reading List Page (/reading-lists)**  
   - Show all user’s reading lists.  
   - Each reading list shows name, whether public/private, and papers inside it.  
   - Button to create new reading list.  
   - Inside a reading list → allow remove papers.  
   - Add button to add a paper to a reading list (from Paper Detail page).

5. **Admin Panel (/admin)**  
   - Role: admin only.  
   - Tabs: Users, Papers.  
   - Users: list all users, delete user.  
   - Papers: list all papers, delete paper.  
   - Confirm modal before delete.  

6. **Stats Page (/stats)**  
   - Fetch top downloaded and top viewed papers.  
   - Display charts (use Recharts).  
   - Show as bar chart (top downloads) and line chart (top views).  

7. **General UI**  
   - Add Navbar with role-based links (papers, upload, reading lists, stats, admin if role=admin).  
   - Responsive design with Tailwind.  
   - Hide/show buttons or links based on role.  
   - Use React Query for all data fetching/mutations.  

8. **File organization**  
   - `/src/pages` → Papers.jsx, PaperDetail.jsx, UploadPaper.jsx, ReadingLists.jsx, Admin.jsx, Stats.jsx.  
   - `/src/components` → Navbar.jsx, PaperCard.jsx, ReadingListCard.jsx, etc.  
   - `/src/hooks` → usePapers.js, useReadingLists.js, useStats.js, etc.  
   - `/src/api/api.js` → axios instance with interceptors.  

9. **Implementation details**  
   - Use `useQuery` for fetching lists and details.  
   - Use `useMutation` for create, update, delete actions.  
   - Include loading and error states (spinners, error messages).  
   - Use Tailwind components for clean design.  

Task:  
- Generate the complete React code for all skeleton pages and components described above.  
- Each page should have minimal UI but connected to backend endpoints.  
- Provide the full file structure and code for each new file.  
- Ensure all routes are added to App.jsx with ProtectedRoute where needed.  
- Output all code in a structured way so I can integrate directly.
